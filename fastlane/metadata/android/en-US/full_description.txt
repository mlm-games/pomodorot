Pomodorot is a timer that can be used for 20-minute breaks during the workday, or as a timer for the Pomodoro Technique.

If you need a timer that pauses the countdown without requiring interaction with the app, this app might be for you.

Features

* Variable time intervals.
* Minimalistic interface.
* Easy on the eyes.
* Open source.
* Completely ad-free.

Currently, the lock screen feature is only available on desktop, but a corresponding setting for Android is planned (mostly after godot adds an easy way to allow the app to run in the background).
